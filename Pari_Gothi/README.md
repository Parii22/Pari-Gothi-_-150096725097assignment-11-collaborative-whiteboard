# 🎨 CollabCanvas — Real-Time Collaborative Multi-User Whiteboard

A high-performance, real-time collaborative whiteboard web application built using **Node.js, Express.js, Socket.io, and the HTML5 Canvas API**. Supports multi-room canvas partitioning, live collaborator cursor tracking, zero-latency vector stroke synchronization, synchronized undo, and instant board clearing.

---

## 🌟 Key Features

1. **Multi-Room Canvas Support**: Partition boards using a room query parameter (e.g., `?board=demo` or `?board=design-101`) or using the built-in room join switcher.
2. **Real-Time Stroke Synchronization**: Vector drawing segments broadcast across peers instantly with high-frequency precision.
3. **In-Memory History Buffer**: Complete stroke history per room is preserved in server memory. New joiners immediately receive all existing drawings on connect via `board:init`.
4. **Live Collaborator Cursor Tracking**: See other users' mouse pointers move across the canvas in real time with unique colors and display names.
5. **Continuous Stroke Undo**: Removes the last complete drawn stroke action (not just single line segments) and broadcasts the updated canvas snapshot (`board:sync`).
6. **Room Canvas Wipe**: Instantly reset and clear the whiteboard across all connected peers (`board:clear` & `board:cleared`).
7. **Clean Disconnect & Lifecycle Handling**: Automatically cleans up peers, removes active cursors, and updates collaborator lists when a peer disconnects.
8. **High-DPI Retina Display Crispness**: Scaled for device pixel ratio with custom tools (Brush, Eraser, Swatches, Custom Color Picker, Size Slider, PNG Export).

## 🔄 Socket.io Event Protocol Specification

### 1. Room & Session Events

| Event Name | Direction | Payload Schema | Description |
|---|:---:|---|---|
| `board:join` | `Client ➔ Server` | `{ "boardId": "demo", "username": "Pari", "userColor": "#3b82f6" }` | Joins a collaborative whiteboard room (`socket.join(boardId)`). |
| `board:init` | `Server ➔ Client` | `{ "strokes": [...], "activeUsers": [...] }` | Emits full existing stroke history and active user list to the joining peer. |
| `user:joined` | `Server ➔ Room` | `{ "userId": "socket_id", "username": "Pari", "color": "#3b82f6" }` | Broadcast to existing room peers when a new member connects. |
| `user:left` | `Server ➔ Room` | `{ "userId": "socket_id", "username": "Pari" }` | Broadcast when a collaborator disconnects. |

### 2. Drawing & Pointer Events

| Event Name | Direction | Payload Schema | Description |
|---|:---:|---|---|
| `draw:stroke` | `Client ➔ Server` | `{ "boardId": "demo", "stroke": { "strokeId": "...", "prevX": 100, "prevY": 50, "currX": 105, "currY": 55, "color": "#3b82f6", "size": 4, "mode": "brush" } }` | Appends a stroke line-segment to room memory buffer. |
| `draw:broadcast` | `Server ➔ Room (broadcast)` | `{ "stroke": { ... } }` | Relays the stroke to all other room participants in real time. |
| `cursor:move` | `Client ➔ Server` | `{ "boardId": "demo", "x": 120, "y": 80 }` | High-frequency mouse/touch coordinates from client. |
| `cursor:update` | `Server ➔ Room (broadcast)` | `{ "userId": "socket_id", "x": 120, "y": 80 }` | Relays peer cursor positions to show live collaborator cursors. |
| `board:clear` | `Client ➔ Server` | `{ "boardId": "demo" }` | Requests server-side canvas reset for the room. |
| `board:cleared` | `Server ➔ Room` | `{ "clearedBy": "Pari" }` | Instructs all room participants to wipe local canvas. |
| `draw:undo` | `Client ➔ Server` | `{ "boardId": "demo" }` | Removes the last continuous stroke action by `strokeId`. |
| `board:sync` | `Server ➔ Room` | `{ "strokes": [...] }` | Broadcasts full state snapshot to redraw canvas after undo. |

## 🚀 Quick Start (Local Setup)

### 1. Install Dependencies
Navigate into the `Pari_Gothi` directory and install the packages:

```bash
cd Pari_Gothi
npm install
```

### 2. Run the Application
For production start:
```bash
npm start
```

For development mode (with hot reloading via `nodemon`):
```bash
npm run dev
```

### 3. Open in Browser
Visit `http://localhost:5000` or open multi-tab tests:
- Window 1: `http://localhost:5000?board=demo`
- Window 2: `http://localhost:5000?board=demo`

---

## 🧪 Testing Verification Flow

1. **Zero-Lag Drawing**: Draw in Window 1 — Window 2 immediately renders the exact stroke.
2. **Live Collaborator Cursor**: Move pointer in Window 1 — Window 2 displays a colored cursor tag following the pointer in real time.
3. **New Joiner History Sync**: Open Window 3 in an Incognito Tab with `?board=demo` — it instantly receives and displays all prior strokes via `board:init`.
4. **Synchronized Undo**: Press Undo (`Ctrl+Z` or Undo button) in Window 1 — the last continuous stroke vanishes in all connected windows via `board:sync`.
5. **Canvas Clear**: Click Clear in Window 1 — all connected windows reset their canvas synchronously via `board:cleared`.
